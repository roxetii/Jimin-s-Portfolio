<button type="button" class="collapsible">Directions I wanted to go in before I discovered application architecture</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Before discovering my interest in application architecture, I wanted to become a clinical psychologist. However, this desire faded after I realized the high level of empathetic proficiency needed (I discovered this through the “occupational research” activity).
    </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How I realized my ideal career pathway</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The “Exploring my Top Jobs” assignment made me realize that application architecture was a field that I was passionate about. Its requirements suit my character, such as firm management, critical thinking, and analytical skills. Meanwhile, it is an interdisciplinary field where I could apply visual art skills (for design), coding skills (for software engineering), and psychology skills (for optimizing user experience). The cherry on top was that working remotely is a definite option for this career, while freelancing is also plausible. </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Future post-secondary choices</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I wish to get a bachelor’s degree in cognitive science. It is an immensely interdisciplinary study field which combines psychology, computer science, linguistics, and philosophy. My preferred post-secondary option is UBC, and I would apply for the bachelor of arts degree (but a bachelor of science is great, too). </p>
